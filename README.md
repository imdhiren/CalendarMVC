Calendar
Implement a calendar application as shown below. There should be Next, Previous, Go To Today functionality as well. It should work same like calendar provided by windows 10.
 

-	There should be previous month dates as well as next month dates to fill top and bottom lines with grey out colors. For eg, in above image there are 30 & 31st May and 1 to 10 July to fill lines.
-	Highlight current date as shown in image
-	Put one more button for Go To Today – clicking on that you need to redraw current months calendar on screen
-	Don’t use calendar control or any third party tool/js/css
-	Render calendar using buttons or html input tags
-	Less use of internet will be added advantage.
-	You can develop this practical in webform OR MVC OR in windows Desktop.
